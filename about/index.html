	<h1>Hi there, I'm Sweta Jain!</h1>
	<p>I'm best defined as an Android developer, having keen interest in music and musical instruments..</p>
		<p>I'm a self learner who is very passionate about making apps, which could help us in our daily life.
			My journey started while I was learning Java.</p> 
		<p>I thought of making an app which could help kids learn alphabets and their correct pronounciation. 
			And I wanted to make 
			that free from ads and annoying music. So that idea formed the foundation of my first app
			<a herf="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swetajain.alphafruits">FRUITY</a>.</p>
			<p>I made and published it without any guidance or help. App was a success for me,
				as it has encountered no ANR error or crashes till date.</p>
